            "rendered": "<p>Social media marketing is one of the most essential elements of digital marketing, and it has affected a revolution in digital media platforms. Social media is now a valuable part of every marketing strategy. The medium has become a crucial element for success in marketing, and many marketers understand the potential of business growth by leveraging such platforms. For businesses, social media has built a space to convey a brand’s messaging to the right people at the right moment. If your content stands enough to attract an audience then it can drive traffic, sales, and even long-term loyalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are the top 7 reasons why businesses must be on social media, and how it can enhance your brand’s success:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increase reach &#8211;</strong> One of the significant benefits of using social media is that it helps you to reach out to a broader audience in very little time. It is important to be consistent with your social media strategy. This involves holding a proper posting schedule, engaging with your audience through likes, shares, and comments, using appropriate hashtags, etc. Doing this will help to grow your visibility and people will start recognizing you. Once people start recognizing your brand, they start trusting you too.</li>\n<li><strong>Encourage engagement &#8211;</strong> Sometimes a simple social media post, such as promoting a pair of shoes, can accept several likes, comments, and shares. People can even ask strangers in the feed if they have received their shoes, how long the shipping took and other possible questions. Social media opens the conversation for instant interaction, relationship building, and customer loyalty.</li>\n<li><strong>Build loyalty and trust &#8211;</strong> Providing your customers to share their stories about their experience with your business on social media is a wonderful form of word-of-mouth marketing. It boosts your online reputation.</li>\n<li><strong>Create brand recognition &#8211;</strong> Gaining brand recognition is one of the most important marketing goals for any company. This is because consumers prefer to purchase brands they are familiar with. Fortunately, social media offers brand building easy and effective. Social media has a big advantage over traditional media. It permits you to get your brand in front of people much more quickly and easily. Furthermore, it attracts the audience’s attention to your brand even when they aren’t thinking about it.</li>\n<li><strong>Cost-effective &#8211;</strong> Social media marketing may be the most cost-effective part of an advertising strategy. Almost all social networking platforms permit you to sign up and create a profile for free, and any paid promotions you choose to invest in, are relatively reasonable when compared to other marketing tactics. Being cost-effective is extremely advantageous because it enables you to see a higher return on investment.</li>\n<li><strong>Higher Conversion Rate &#8211;</strong> Your business will have more growth opportunities as a result of higher visibility. Every blog post, photograph, video, or remark has the potential to drive traffic to your company’s website. Social media marketing permits your company to make a great impression. It personifies a brand when it interacts with customers by sharing content, commenting, and updating statuses on social media.</li>\n<li><strong>Increases Brand Authority &#8211;</strong> Customer satisfaction and brand loyalty both contribute to your company’s authority, but it all comes down to communication. When consumers see your company posting on social media, especially when they see you responding to consumers and posting original content, they assume you are more reliable. Interacting with customers constantly reveals that your company appreciates customer satisfaction and is available to answer any questions they may have.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-215 aligncenter\" src=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SMM_2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" /></p>\n<p>Social media is a land of new opportunities. There are countless personal and professional advantages of using social media. With a little love and care, we can start to develop and grow our brands into an epicenter of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

However, it is the most prominent tool for building a brand image for your company through the internet. It not only enhances your company to boost sales, but it is also helpful in allowing you to build your brand in the industry. Whether you have just started your business or thinking about starting one, an engaging website will support your business to new heights quickly. Launching a website is one of the greatest challenges for many businesses, as the website is the primary impression that your customers will have. So, it is highly important to pick the <strong>best website designing company in Delhi</strong> that understands your goal and delivers the best results.</p>\n<p><strong>Let’s have a look at the factors that are required to examine while choosing a website design company:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Read client reviews</strong> – Read the reviews and testimonials that a client has given to the company. Some websites gather company feedback that are helpful in grasping what people are speaking about the business. Also, any established web designing company will have various previous clients. You can reach out to any previous client of the company, especially ones with a similar project as yours and ask about their experience with the company.</li>\n<li><strong>Examine their social media presence &#8211;</strong> When you are looking to choose the best website designing company, take a glance at a company’s social presence, a strong social media appearance is usually a good sign. Check all the platforms where they have shared their services including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, and rely on a company which has a good social media presence although you should also examine other factors.</li>\n<li><strong>Updated with the latest trends and designs &#8211;</strong> You can no longer keep going for those old school designs since it is the era of changes and experimentation. The web designing company should be modernised with the most advanced technology and trending designs. The website should look fresh and attract viewers therefore, there should be a balance between what is modern and already proven.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn about their additional services &#8211;</strong> When you are launching a website, you may not need any extra development service initially but in the long run, you may want services like SEO and graphics.

            "rendered": "<p>Content marketing is the strategy that generates valuable and relevant content in order to attract its audiences. The long-term plan is that content marketing will generate new customers, but the near-term goal is to consistently provide thoughtful content that audiences look forward to consuming. </p>\n<p>As a video production company, you will surely enjoy drafting videos for other businesses. But at the same time, you need a few methods to promote your video production company which can be done through content marketing like blogs, videos, social media posts, etc. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class = \"mb-3\">Here are some ways how to use content marketing for your video production company:</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class = \" mt-2 mb-3\">1.BLOG: </strong></p>\n<p>A blog can serve as a significant content marketing and a gateway to drive traffic to your site. If you are posting regularly, blogging can help your company or brand to attract a large number of people by sharing knowledge with the world and becoming a trusted voice in your industry. To build your brand through your blog, create new and unique content in a timely manner. Most primarily, avoid posting the same information that your competitors are posting. A good idea is to take a topic that you have already written about, break it down, and write in detail about the smaller components.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong class = \"mb-3\">2. STORYTELLING THROUGH VIDEO: </strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons to post videos on social media is that it allows you to tell stories that can connect you to your target audience. Because videos are a mixture of visuals, motion, and sounds, they allow you to make deep and more meaningful connections with people while positioning your brand in the best possible way. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class = \"mb-3\">3. PODCASTS: </strong></p>\n<p>Through your podcast episodes, you will be able to share your vision, your goals, and your ideology. Your listeners will get to hear your voice and be better able to connect with your company through podcasts. Using a podcast to cultivate business growth is a way to generate traffic to your company’s website. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class = \"mb-3\">4. INTERVIEWS:  </strong></p>\n<p>With guest speakers, interviews are an excellent way of introducing your audience to a new influencer and vice versa. Handing the virtual mic over to a guest can be fun and provide a little more authenticity to your brand or company. When the influencer promotes you to their audience, you will get a boost of traffic and visibility, which can mean more followers for you, and more people interested in your course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class = \"mb-3\">5. TESTIMONIALS: In  </strong></p>\n<p>In marketing, these videos look like customer highlights and help to create social proof for your brand or company. Videos that showcase how a customer uses your product or service and their satisfaction. Ideally, potential customers will see themselves in that video and be persuaded to purchase.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong class = \"mt-2 mb-3\">6. BE ACTIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA:  </strong></p>\n<p>Social media is one of the simplest methods to promote and market your company. Just remember that running the social media of your company takes plenty of time and effort, if you set a good strategy. Since social media content is easily shareable, your target audience can grow your reach through word-of-mouth publicity on social media.

Provide Answers To Your Audience’s Questions: </strong> It is very important to know why and what are you doing that directly means that you should always be prepared to answer your target audience questions.

It takes time and proper knowledge to know what to post and when to post it. Here are a few reasons why you should create a content calendar for your business:<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>1. Save time by being organized</strong> Organizing a social media calendar lets you plan ahead, batch your work, avoid multitasking, and jot down all your creative brainwaves for later.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>2. Post consistently</strong> Consistently showing up in your audience’s feed is the highlight to engage your audience socially. Impressive engagement is helpful in increasing your organic reach via the platform’s algorithm, so your posts get shown to new eyes, and your brand gets a new list of followers.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>3. Make little typos, and also reduce the risk of big mistakes</strong> A social media calendar, especially one with team member approvals built-in, is the perfect way to stop a low-key embarrassment like posting the same message across channels, or a high-key social media crisis.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>4. Get more ambitious with your social strategies</strong> Once you have your schedule ready, your distinguished brain is freed up to tackle even bigger questions. Should you run an Instagram contest? Start looking for influencer partners? Is it time to get your brand on LinkedIn, or introduce a social media employee advocacy program?<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5.

If you are still not sure if you should go responsive, then here are some benefits of responsive web design that may influence your decision:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>1) Engage an extensive audience</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your audience will access your website from a wide range of different devices in all shapes and sizes. Responsive design will fit in with them no matter how big or small their screen is.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>2) Easier to monitor analytics</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have different websites for different devices that means you have to supervise two analytics. A responsive website is just one website, meaning your data is just one source of information &amp; documents.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>3) Easier to sustain</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As discussed earlier, different websites for different devices means any modifications need to be made across all of them. With a responsive website it means you have to make the change only once.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>4) Boost for SEO</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing your business is evidently important for you to be found and SEO is one of the best methods to drive traffic to your website. Google are now, in order to enhance their search results for mobile users, favouring responsive websites so they emerge higher on the search engines results.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>5) Stability in design and brand</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evidently you can design and customise a mobile website and a traditional website; although you will never get the similar look and feel better of the two. A responsive website will maintain the same design across all devices.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>6) Lower bounce rates</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your potential audiences aren’t going to put up with a slow, tough to use website. If your website isn’t compatible with the device they are using then they will simply go back from your website and move to one of your competitors. Your target audience doesn’t want to wait around; they want fast solutions easily. A responsive website will minimize the bounce rate with quick loading, easy to use navigation and clear call-to-actions.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>7) Enhanced conversion rates</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a responsive website is the best choice for your web design needs as it delivers the finest user-experience. A responsive website will enhance sales as it will reach a larger, more target audience and provide them the smooth and easy experience they are looking for.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

You want to know how many people are detecting your content and what percentage of them actually purchase your product, sign up for your email list, or carry out any other desired activity. Do you know? Every feature of marketing is completely pointless unless it assembles conversions. If you’re not aware of your conversion rate now, then you’re not aware what components of your website or marketing strategy you need to enhance. Your conversions will likely fester as an outcome, which could result in critical lost profits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting traffic to your website is significant, but if that traffic doesn’t transfigure, it’s almost worthless. This article will outline some demonstrated strategies for getting your visitors to take measure, whether that’s filling out a form, assisting over their email address or making a purchase.</span><b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Include as little fields as feasible: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When requesting for details in an email opt-in form, request for as little information as required. </span></li>\n<li><b>Add a guarantee: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Involve a no-questions-asked refund policy on all purchases. This minimizes risk, and increased sales will normally more than make up for any returns.</span></li>\n<li><b>Use substantial action verbs: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When testing out different calls to action, try using action language that encourages visitors to take action (for example, &#8220;grab yours,&#8221; &#8220;reserve your seat&#8221;)</span><br />\n<b></b></li>\n<li><b>Use testimonials: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testimonials minimize risk and furnish social proof. Utilize them on product landing pages as well as on your email opt-in landing page.</span></li>\n<li><b>Clearly state the advantages of your product or service: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listing the characteristics of your product is crucial, but it’s even more significant to tell potential customers precisely how your product will help them or solve their problem.</span></li>\n<li><b> Pay careful attention to your headline: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your headline is perhaps the single most crucial component of your landing page. Brainstorm at least 10 possibilities before selecting the strongest one.</span><br />\n<b></b></li>\n<li><b>Use video to enlighten your brand: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include a simple video on landing pages to show there’s an authentic person behind your brand.</span></li>\n<li><b>Generate committed landing pages for pay-per-click ads: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re using AdWords or another form of PPC ads, ensure to send these visitors to a committed landing page (not your home page!).</span></li>\n<li><b>Embrace subscriber or social-media follower counts: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like testimonials, including social proof helps minimize risk and enhance conversions.</span></li>\n<li><b>Recommend related products: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include links to corresponding content or products to keep visitors engaged and on your site.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50 size-large\" src=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ad_2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ad_2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ad_2-300x169.png 300w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ad_2-768x432.png 768w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ad_2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ad_2-2048x1152.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovering how to enhance your conversion rate literally isn’t difficult.

Today, our world revolves around online reputation, internet marketing, online business, online degrees, social media presence, and internet banking. This is the most important reason behind the fact that the internet matters in our lives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our lives are totally dependent on the Internet as we rely on the internet to get directions, recipes, DIYs, etc. in just a few seconds. Apart from that, the Internet is also one of the best time pass choices for us at the airport, in the car and train. For example, even if you have no clue about what to eat today in breakfast, lunch, and dinner then you can simply search the best food recipes on the internet. The Internet is always there to provide you freedom from food restrictions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other terms, the Internet has opened a new world for thousands of people around the world. The internet is continuously providing different opportunities to different people. It is an expression of never-ending innovation and creativity. The internet knows no boundary but brings a wide economic opportunities for people in every country. The Internet allows people to enhance the quality of their life.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66 size-large\" src=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/int_1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/int_1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/int_1-300x169.png 300w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/int_1-768x432.png 768w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/int_1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/int_1-2048x1152.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Why Does the Internet Matter the Most?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internet has impacted almost every aspect of human life and this includes not only private life but also public services. Presently, nobody can prevent other individuals from revealing their private life to the public. For example, most of the couples and families even post the images or videos of their family vacation in remote areas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side, the internet also permits the public to know what the government is doing. Now even people on the street know what is happening among the political parties and the government officials. It gives freedom to a company to what the competitors are doing and going to launch and similarly, allows the public to criticize what the producers offer. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Future of Internet and Its Roles</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internet is for everyone. It moulds a new manifesto in business and public services. It provides energy for more people to mould their own life by creating advantages of the wide-open opportunities. Currently, more people are still the internet users, instead of network owners. However, along with its increasingly significant roles, the internet will become a universally approachable platform, which will permit people to have enhanced life quality. Although, to realize this, a regulation is necessary to make sure that everything is at the right line.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

With social distancing increasing, we at </span><b>Luhaif Digitech</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are trying to look on the bright side. When you run a small business, it is very time consuming and sometimes you forget to work on the internal workings that help our businesses run. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-23 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ways_4-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ways_4-1024x576.png 1024w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ways_4-300x169.png 300w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ways_4-768x432.png 768w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ways_4-1536x864.png 1536w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ways_4-2048x1152.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a lot of “quarantined” free time, here sharing the nine ways to improve your business during the COVID-19 pandemic:</span></p>\n<p><b>Improve Your Website: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you been putting off that new web design? Do you have elements you have wanted to add but don’t want the website downtime? Well, we have some downtime. There may not be a right time with business paused than now, to enhance your company website.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Add Automation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Marketing automation is one of the four most popular techniques for generating personalized customer experiences. Even if it is something easier, like adding a chatbot to your website, automation will enhance your business efficiencies as it continues to expand once the coronavirus is behind us. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Content Creation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Freshen up your brand by redesigning some of your marketing collateral. Here at </span><b>Luhaif Digitech</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we are in the procedure of doing just that. Get rid of the old flyers, business cards, and brochures and bring in some designs to upgrade your brand image. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Search Engine Optimization</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 70-80% of search engine users are only emphasizing on the organic results and investing in search has never been more crucial. Building an SEO strategy and executing it takes time, discipline and strategic execution. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Google My Business Page: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A typical business encounters 59 actions from their Google My Business listing each month. On average, 56% of actions on Google My Business listings are website visits which offer a great opportunity to transform visitors into customers. Take some time and make sure you have a Google My Business Page and that it is fully working. Google has executed a lot of additions to the Google My Business platform recently. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Get Reviews: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reviews are mandatory in gaining customers in the digital age. There is no excuse now for not reaching out to those customers you have done such a great job with to ask for a review. And better yet, they don’t have an excuse for not leaving you a review! In times like these, we need to help each other out. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Send Thank You Notes to Clients:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A simple thank you goes a long way in appreciating your customers or clients. Get out the pen and paper and send a thank you the old fashion way. It’s a great way to maintain high customer retention rates and an even better way to make someone’s day that may be in need of hearing some appreciation during this pandemic. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Start a Business Blog:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Have you been wanting to include a blog section to your website? Get to typing&#8217;! A blog does miracles for your visitor engagement, visitor acquisition, and your website SEO. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Learn &amp; Grow:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We don’t know how many times we find an excuse to not pick up a book or dive into some up and coming marketing tactics. During our quarantine, the LEAST we can do is learn and grow as individuals and as professionals. Take a glance at some books on audible or dive down the YouTube rabbit hole for some industry-specific techniques you may need some refreshing on. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-28 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ways_5-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ways_5-1024x576.png 1024w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ways_5-300x169.png 300w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ways_5-768x432.png 768w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ways_5-1536x864.png 1536w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ways_5-2048x1152.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we weather and fight the storm that is the coronavirus, know that </span><b>Luhaif Digitech</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is here to assist you and your small business.

Times have changed now and so have keyword searches on the search engine pages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you’re a restaurant owner your keyword search may just have to change from “best restaurant in South Delhi” to “best cheese pizza”. Put out your restaurant videos on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook. You can also go for competitive SEO, to make sure your video ranked high and gets highest traffic. You could hold up this with ads and posts on social media.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once more, it doesn’t matter what business you’re in, there are methods to working around how you can remain noticeable online.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Let your audience feel your presence</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let your target audience know that you’re still throughout. Send your target audience emailers to let them know what you’re doing, whether you are delivering, giving food and shelter to the needy, helping your employees or just doing your bit by staying home and staying safe. This is a right time to get innovative and put this out in the form of videos on your social media platforms. They don’t have to price a thing.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55 size-large\" src=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bu_1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bu_1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bu_1-300x169.png 300w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bu_1-768x432.png 768w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bu_1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bu_1-2048x1152.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, it is best to focus on your short-term strategies, because the future is quite uncertain.

            "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online marketing is the procedure of powering web-based channels to spread a message about a company’s brand, products, or services to its capable and potential customers. The procedures and techniques used for online marketing incorporate email, social media, display advertising, search engine optimization, Google AdWords and more. The mission of marketing is to reach potential customers through the channels where they spend their time reading, searching, shopping, and socializing online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extensive adoption of the internet for business and personal use has created new channels for advertising and marketing engagement, incorporating those mentioned above. There are also many advantages and challenges inherent to online marketing, which utilizes essentially digital mediums to attract, involve, and convert virtual visitors to customers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online marketing is different from traditional marketing, which has retrogressively included mediums like print, billboard, television and radio advertisements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before online marketing channels appeared, the cost to market products or services was at times prohibitively expensive, and traditionally difficult to measure. Think of national TV ad campaigns, which are quantified through consumer focus groups to determine levels of brand awareness. These procedures are traditionally not well-suited to controlled experimentation. Presently, anyone with an online business (as well as most offline businesses) can engage in online marketing by generating a website and creating customer acquisition campaigns at very minimum cost. Those marketing products and services also have the capability to investigate with optimization to fine-tune their campaigns’ efficiency and ROI.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86 size-large\" src=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OL_1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OL_1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OL_1-300x169.png 300w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OL_1-768x432.png 768w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OL_1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://luhaifdigitech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OL_1-2048x1152.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Benefits Of Online Marketing</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fundamental benefit of using online channels for marketing a business or product is the capability to quantify the influence of any given channel, as well as how visitors obtained through various channels interact with a website or landing page experience. Of the visitors that transfigure into paying customers, further analysis can be done to discover which channels are most successful at acquiring valuable customers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Analytics for web or mobile app experiences can help discover the following:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which online marketing channels are the most cost-effective at obtaining customers, based on the transformation rate of visitors to customers, and the cost of those visitors?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which channels are successful at acquiring and driving extensive lifetime value for customers like email marketing, which drives repeat purchases to prior customers?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which group of customers reveal strong engagement behaviour and high powered for upsells like software or mobile apps, which expect to sell more products to customers with high involvement?</span></li>\n</ul>\n",
