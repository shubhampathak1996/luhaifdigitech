    // subtitle: 'Design Work'ing,
    paragraph: `
    <p>Responsive web design is very important for any estate agent that is serious about providing the best for their audience.</p>
     <p>
     A responsive website will furnish the greatest user-experience across all devices and has many other benefits. If you are still not sure if you should go responsive, then here are some benefits of responsive web design that may influence your decision:
    </p>
   

    <h3>1) Engage an extensive audience</h3>
    <p>Your audience will access your website from a wide range of different devices in all shapes and sizes. Responsive design will fit in with them no matter how big or small their screen is.</p>
    

    <h3>2) Easier to monitor analytics</h3>
    <p>If you have different websites for different devices that means you have to supervise two analytics. A responsive website is just one website, meaning your data is just one source of information & documents.</p>

    <h3>3) Easier to sustain</h3>
    <p>As discussed earlier, different websites for different devices means any modifications need to be made across all of them. With a responsive website it means you have to make the change only once.</p>

    <h3>4) Boost for SEO</h3>
    <p>
    Marketing your business is evidently important for you to be found and SEO is one of the best methods to drive traffic to your website.

    </p>
    
    <h3>6) Lower bounce rates</h3>
    <p>Your potential audiences aren’t going to put up with a slow, tough to use website. If your website isn’t compatible with the device they are using then they will simply go back from your website and move to one of your competitors.

A responsive website will minimize the bounce rate with quick loading, easy to use navigation and clear call-to-actions.</p>

    title: 'What is the Internet of Things?',
    // subtitle: 'Design Work'ing,
    paragraph: `
    <p>The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> also known as <strong><strong>IoT</strong></strong>, in simple terms means the billions of physical devices that are now connected to the internet around the world, all these devices collect and share data. The term <strong>IoT</strong> is mostly used for devices that wouldn’t normally be expected to have an internet connection, and that can communicate with the network independently of human action. For example for some specific reason, a PC isn’t generally considered an <strong>IoT</strong> device and similarly neither is a smartphone even though the latter is overloaded with sensors. On the other hand, a fitness band or a smartwatch or other wearable device might be counted as an <strong>IoT</strong> device.</p>

     <p>
     Therefore, in brief the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> is the concept of connecting any type of device as long as it has an on/off switch to the Internet and to other connected devices. The <strong>IoT</strong> is a huge network of connected people and things, all of them collect and share data about the method they are used or managed and about the environment around them.
    </p>

    <p>There are a number of objects of different shapes and sizes around us like fitness watches, driverless cars, microwaves and many more.</p>

    <p>Hence, the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> is making the framework of the world around us smarter and more responsive by merging the digital and physical universes.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>

    <p>All the devices and objects with built in sensors are attached to an <strong>Internet of Things</strong> platform, which consolidates data from the different devices and applies analytics to share the most beneficial information with applications built to address specific requirements.</p>

    <p>The powerful <strong>IoT</strong> platforms can precisely pinpoint exactly what information is beneficial and what can safely be overlooked. This information can be used to detect patterns, make recommendations, and detect possible problems before they take place. For example, if someone who owns a car manufacturing business, that person might want to know which optional components (like leather seats or alloy wheels) are the most prominent or fashionable.</p>

    <p>Using <strong>Internet of Things</strong> technology, that person easily can:</p>

    <p>Use sensors to detect which areas in a showroom are the most popular, and where customers stick around longest.
    Drill down into the available sales data to recognize which elements are selling fastest.
    Instinctively align sales data with supply, so that marketable or well-liked items don’t go out of stock.
    The information collected by connected devices authorizes the person to make smart decisions about which elements to stock up on, based on real-time information, which helps him to save time and money.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is <strong>IoT</strong> important?</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> assists people to live and work smarter, and also gain complete control over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to automate homes, <strong>IoT</strong> is essential to business. <strong>IoT</strong> offers businesses with a real-time look into how their systems really function, and delivers insights into everything from the functioning of machines to supply chain and logistics operations.</p>

    <p>Therefore, <strong>IoT</strong> is one of the most influential technologies of everyday life, and it will continue to pick up steam as more businesses recognize the potential of connected devices to keep them competitive.
    </p>

    <p>The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> is actually a pretty simple concept, it means taking all the things in the world and connecting them to the internet.</p>

    // subtitle: 'Design Work'ing,
    paragraph: `
    <p>Are you looking to improve your website conversions?</p>

    <p>For that you need to understand first what exactly is a Conversion Rate?</p>

    <p>Conversion rate is demonstrated in percentage form based on a ratio. It’s the part of your website visitors who convert or transform on an offer. Visitors can convert on lead magnets, webinar registrations, sales, and more. You can trace conversion rates for all of those activities.</p>

    <p>Although, you can’t just trace the number of people who literally convert. You want to know how many people are detecting your content and what percentage of them actually purchase your product, sign up for your email list, or carry out any other desired activity. Do you know? Every feature of marketing is completely pointless unless it assembles conversions. If you’re not aware of your conversion rate now, then you’re not aware what components of your website or marketing strategy you need to enhance. Your conversions will likely fester as an outcome, which could result in critical lost profits.</p>

    <p>Getting traffic to your website is significant, but if that traffic doesn’t transfigure, it’s almost worthless. This article will outline some demonstrated strategies for getting your visitors to take measure, whether that’s filling out a form, assisting over their email address or making a purchase.
</p>

    <h3>Include as little fields as feasible:</h3>
    <p>When requesting for details in an email opt-in form, request for as little information as required. </p>

    <h3>Add a guarantee: h3>
    <p>Involve a no-questions-asked refund policy on all purchases. This minimizes risk, and increased sales will normally more than make up for any returns.</p>

    <h3>Use substantial action verbs: </h3>
    <p>When testing out different calls to action, try using action language that encourages visitors to take action (for example, “grab yours,” “reserve your seat”)</p>

    <h3>Use testimonials:</h3>
    <p>Testimonials minimize risk and furnish social proof. Utilize them on product landing pages as well as on your email opt-in landing page.</p>

    <h3>Clearly state the advantages of your product or service: </h3>
    <p>Listing the characteristics of your product is crucial, but it’s even more significant to tell potential customers precisely how your product will help them or solve their problem.</p>

    <h3> Pay careful attention to your headline:</h3>
    <p> Your headline is perhaps the single most crucial component of your landing page. Brainstorm at least 10 possibilities before selecting the strongest one.</p>

    <h3>Use video to enlighten your brand:</h3>
    <p>Include a simple video on landing pages to show there’s an authentic person behind your brand.</p>

    <h3>Generate committed landing pages for pay-per-click ads: </h3>
    <p>If you’re using AdWords or another form of PPC ads, ensure to send these visitors to a committed landing page (not your home page!).</p>

    <h3>Embrace subscriber or social-media follower counts:</h3>
    <p> Just like testimonials, including social proof helps minimize risk and enhance conversions.</p>

    <p>The Coronavirus outbreak has made many businesses wind up or at least work from home, compelling them to rework their Internet marketing strategies among many other things. The Young Presidents’ Organization (YPO) survey suggested that around 82% of business leaders are anticipating significant declines in revenues over the course of the next six months. These figures seem unfavourable. Then, how does a business owner conduct his marketing spend intelligently and stay floating during these times?
    </p>

    <h3>Make short-term and long-term strategies:</h3>
    <p>We are not sure how long this pandemic will last. Hence, you need to form: </p>

    <p><strong>Short term strategies </strong> to stay noticeable and pertinent during this difficult time. This is a perfect opportunity to focus on establishing a connection with your customer and doing some brand building
    </p>

    <p><strong>Long term strategies</strong> to recover from a business drop and bring back lost customers. 
    </p>

    <p>It doesn’t bother whether you’re a producing business or a service provider, your approaches would be broadly based on the same principle. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Short term strategies</strong>Re-visit your keywords. Times have changed now and so have keyword searches on the search engine pages.  
    </p>

    <p>For example, if you’re a restaurant owner your keyword search may just have to change from “best restaurant in South Delhi” to “best cheese pizza”. Put out your restaurant videos on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook. You can also go for competitive SEO, to make sure your video ranked high and gets highest traffic. You could hold up this with ads and posts on social media.  
    </p>

    <p>Once more, it doesn’t matter what business you’re in, there are methods to working around how you can remain noticeable online.
    </p>

    <h3>Let your audience feel your presence</h3>
    <p>Let your target audience know that you’re still throughout. Send your target audience emailers to let them know what you’re doing, whether you are delivering, giving food and shelter to the needy, helping your employees or just doing your bit by staying home and staying safe. This is a right time to get innovative and put this out in the form of videos on your social media platforms. They don’t have to price a thing.
    </p>

    <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
    <p>
    Meanwhile, it is best to focus on your short-term strategies, because the future is quite uncertain. Stay concentrated on remaining visibility, not letting your target audience forget you and providing services in the best way that you can in the current scenario.

    Online marketing is the procedure of powering web-based channels to spread a message about a company’s brand, products, or services to its capable and potential customers. The procedures and techniques used for online marketing incorporate email, social media, display advertising, search engine optimization, Google AdWords and more. The mission of marketing is to reach potential customers through the channels where they spend their time reading, searching, shopping, and socializing online.
    </p>

    <p>Extensive adoption of the internet for business and personal use has created new channels for advertising and marketing engagement, incorporating those mentioned above. There are also many advantages and challenges inherent to online marketing, which utilizes essentially digital mediums to attract, involve, and convert virtual visitors to customers.
    </p>

    <p>Online marketing is different from traditional marketing, which has retrogressively included mediums like print, billboard, television and radio advertisements.
    </p>

    <p>Before online marketing channels appeared, the cost to market products or services was at times prohibitively expensive, and traditionally difficult to measure. Think of national TV ad campaigns, which are quantified through consumer focus groups to determine levels of brand awareness. These procedures are traditionally not well-suited to controlled experimentation. Presently, anyone with an online business (as well as most offline businesses) can engage in online marketing by generating a website and creating customer acquisition campaigns at very minimum cost. Those marketing products and services also have the capability to investigate with optimization to fine-tune their campaigns’ efficiency and ROI.
    </p>

    <h3>Benefits Of Online Marketing
    </h3>
    <p>A fundamental benefit of using online channels for marketing a business or product is the capability to quantify the influence of any given channel, as well as how visitors obtained through various channels interact with a website or landing page experience. Of the visitors that transfigure into paying customers, further analysis can be done to discover which channels are most successful at acquiring valuable customers.
    </p>

    <h3>Analytics for web or mobile app experiences can help discover the following:</h3>
    <p>Which online marketing channels are the most cost-effective at obtaining customers, based on the transformation rate of visitors to customers, and the cost of those visitors?
    </p>

    <p>Which channels are successful at acquiring and driving extensive lifetime value for customers like email marketing, which drives repeat purchases to prior customers? 
    </p>

    <p>We as the best digital marketing company utilize a blend of digital channels to enhance the visibility, revenues and conversion of our client’s businesses.
    </p>

    <p>
    Which group of customers reveal strong engagement behaviour and high powered for upsells like software or mobile apps, which expect to sell more products to customers with high involvement?
